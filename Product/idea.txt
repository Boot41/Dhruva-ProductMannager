. System Architecture

Your AI agent has 4 main modules:

A. Requirement Understanding & Breakdown

Input: Product requirements + Tech stack.

Process:

Parse requirements into features (e.g., login, cart, payment).

Break each feature into milestones (e.g., schema, API, UI).

Break milestones into day-to-day tasks (e.g., "Implement user table", "Create React login form").

Output: Structured roadmap.

👉 You’ll need LLM-powered task decomposition + a knowledge base of software engineering best practices (like React + SpringBoot + DB patterns).

B. Skill Mapping & Task Assignment

Input: Team skill matrix {member : {skill: level}}.

Process:

Match tasks with required skills (e.g., React tasks → strong frontend dev).

Prefer senior devs for critical architecture/design work.

Distribute smaller tasks to juniors.

Output: Task allocation plan.

👉 This is like constraint-based optimization (match skill × availability × priority).

C. Effort Estimation & Scheduling

Input: Task list + team availability.

Process:

Estimate time per task (heuristics: skill level vs difficulty).

Build a Gantt chart / sprint plan.

Parallelize tasks if dependencies allow.

Output: Day-to-day sprint plan.

👉 Think Agile sprint generator + critical path method.

D. Development Cycle Automation

Task Assignment → Dev starts coding.

AI Code Review:

Linting, static analysis, security checks.

Suggest improvements.

If rejected → send back.

Senior Review (human in loop).

Merge → Integration Tests.

Feature Complete → Mark milestone done.

👉 This uses LLM + code understanding models (like CodeLlama, GPT-4o) with context from repos.

Generative UI Layer (Team Dashboard)

This is the window into the AI’s brain:

Dynamic Gantt chart / Sprint board

Generated from task breakdown + dependencies.

Auto-updates as tasks complete.

Skill-task assignment view

Visual heatmap of who is overloaded, who is free.

Progress Tracker

Task states: Not Started → In Progress → AI Review → Senior Review → Done.

Code Review Visuals

Inline diffs, previews of UI components.

Adaptive UI

As project shifts, dashboard layout reconfigures (e.g., showing new columns when “Payment” milestone starts).

👉 Gen UI ensures no manual dashboard setup — it evolves with the project.
