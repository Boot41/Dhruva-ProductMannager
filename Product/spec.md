# Product Manager AI – Functional and Technical Specification

## 1. Overview
- **Purpose**: An AI agent that converts product requirements and tech stack into a structured roadmap, assigns tasks to team members based on skills, estimates effort, schedules work, and automates parts of the development cycle with reviews and tracking via a generative UI.
- **Primary Users**: Product managers, engineering managers, developers.
- **Scope**:
  - Requirement parsing and task decomposition
  - Skill mapping and task assignment
  - Effort estimation and scheduling
  - Development cycle automation and reviews
  - Generative dashboard for progress and workload visualization

## 2. Goals and Non‑Goals
- **Goals**
  - Parse freeform product requirements into features → milestones → day-to-day tasks
  - Map tasks to appropriate team members using a skill matrix and constraints
  - Produce sprint plans and/or Gantt schedules with dependencies and parallelization
  - Automate linting/static/security checks and provide AI code review suggestions
  - Provide a live, adaptive dashboard (sprint board, heatmaps, diffs, progress)
- **Non‑Goals (initial release)**
  - Deep IDE integration beyond code review comments
  - Replacing human senior review; it remains human-in-the-loop
  - Full project accounting/billing or HR features

## 3. System Architecture

### A. Requirement Understanding & Breakdown
- **Input**: Product requirements (text, docs) + tech stack metadata
- **Process**:
  - Parse requirements into features (e.g., login, cart, payment)
  - For each feature: derive milestones (schema, API, UI)
  - For each milestone: derive day-to-day tasks (e.g., “Implement user table”, “Create React login form”)
- **Output**: Structured roadmap (Features → Milestones → Tasks)
- **Tech**: LLM-powered task decomposition + embedded knowledge base (best practices for React, Spring Boot, DB patterns)

### B. Skill Mapping & Task Assignment
- **Input**: Team skill matrix `{ member: { skill: level } }`, availability, task list
- **Process**:
  - Infer required skills per task; match tasks to members
  - Prioritize senior engineers for critical architecture/design
  - Distribute granular tasks to junior engineers
  - Respect constraints (availability, priority, dependencies)
- **Output**: Assignment plan per sprint/period
- **Tech**: Constraint-based optimization (e.g., greedy + backtracking or ILP heuristic)

### C. Effort Estimation & Scheduling
- **Input**: Task list + dependencies + team availability
- **Process**:
  - Estimate time per task using heuristics calibrated by skill/difficulty
  - Build sprint plan and/or Gantt chart; parallelize where possible
  - Compute critical path and highlight bottlenecks/slack
- **Output**: Timeboxed plan (sprints), Gantt chart data, dates
- **Tech**: Agile sprint planner + CPM; simple velocity model per person

### D. Development Cycle Automation
- **Flow**: Assignment → Coding → AI Review → Senior Review → Merge → Integration Tests → Milestone Done
- **AI Review**: Linting, static analysis, security checks, improvement suggestions; if rejected, task returns to dev
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Senior review remains required for merges on critical paths
- **Tech**: LLM + code understanding models with repository context

## 4. Generative UI Layer (Team Dashboard)
- **Views**
  - Dynamic Gantt/Sprint board from decomposition and dependencies (auto-updates)
  - Skill-task assignment heatmap (overload vs free capacity)
  - Progress tracker: Not Started → In Progress → AI Review → Senior Review → Done
  - Code review visuals: inline diffs, UI previews
- **Adaptive UI**: Layout reconfigures as project focus shifts (e.g., new columns when “Payment” milestone starts)

## 5. Data Model (Initial)
- **Requirement**: id, title, description, tags, tech_stack
- **Feature**: id, requirement_id, name, description, priority
- **Milestone**: id, feature_id, name, description, start_date, due_date, status
- **Task**: id, milestone_id, title, description, required_skills[], difficulty, estimate_hrs, assignee_id, status, dependencies[]
- **Member**: id, name, role, skills{skill:level}, availability{period:hours}
- **Assignment**: id, task_id, member_id, start, end, confidence
- **Review**: id, task_id, type{AI|Senior}, status, findings, suggested_changes

## 6. Key APIs (Sketch)
- `POST /requirements:parse` → {features[], milestones[], tasks[]}
- `POST /assignments:plan` → {assignments[], unassigned_tasks[]}
- `POST /schedule:generate` → {sprints[], gantt[]}
- `POST /review:run` → {findings[], score, recommendations}
- `GET /dashboard:state` → aggregate for UI (tasks, statuses, charts)

## 7. Estimation & Scheduling Logic
- Difficulty-to-hours baseline by task type; adjust by assignee skill level
- Respect dependencies; compute critical path; enable parallel tracks
- Sprint sizing by capacity (availability × velocity)

## 8. Reviews & Quality Gates
- Pre-merge checks: lint, static analysis, security scan
- AI suggestions must be reviewable and traceable; rejection routes back to “In Progress”
- Senior review required for high-risk changes

## 9. Security & Privacy
- No storage of raw proprietary requirements beyond project scope
- Secrets handled via secure vault; no keys in logs
- PII minimized in dashboards; RBAC for visibility

## 10. Metrics & Telemetry
- Task lead/cycle time, review turnaround, plan vs actual, assignment balance
- Model quality: acceptance rate of AI suggestions, false-positive rate in checks

## 11. Assumptions
- Access to repository metadata and CI
- Team provides up-to-date skill matrix and availability
- Initial heuristics acceptable; will calibrate with project data

## 12. Risks & Mitigations
- Parsing ambiguity → provide human confirmation step and editable plan
- Over/under-estimation → calibrate with feedback loops and historicals
- Assignment fairness → constraint solver with fairness objectives

## 13. Milestones (Initial)
1) Requirement parser MVP → features/milestones/tasks JSON
2) Assignment engine MVP → assign 70%+ tasks
3) Scheduler MVP → sprints and Gantt output
4) AI review pipeline → lint, static, security with suggestions
5) Generative dashboard → boards, heatmap, diffs, adaptive layout

## 14. Open Questions
- Preferred CI/CD toolchain to integrate for reviews/tests?
- Target stacks to seed knowledge base (exact frameworks/versions)?
- Data persistence choice (SQL vs NoSQL) and schema evolution approach?
